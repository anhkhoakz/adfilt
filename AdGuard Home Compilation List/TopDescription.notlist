! Description: AdGuard Home is one of the tools for the future. However, its current internal structure discards virtually every $-using block rule (e.g. EasyList), which makes EasyList and similar lists virtually useless in AdGuard Home, despite how many of the entries would be ≥90% as functional without them. So here's my combined list to work around it.
! Motivation: Originally conceived as a temporary workaround to use major adblocker lists in AdGuard Base, it gradually grew in scope to become a de facto competitor to «AdGuard DNS Filter» with broader wildcard use and no tracker-blocking.
! Note: The list IS NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES designed with uBlock Origin in mind, for which I recommend turning on the various individual source lists instead.
