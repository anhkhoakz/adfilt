! Title: ðŸ”µðŸ”´ðŸŸ ðŸŸ£ MeWe Happy Time Fun Club
! Version: 30December2023v1-Deprecated
! Expires: 6 days
! Description: This list aims to restore MeWe to its late 2017 state, before public post sharing and the Â«PagesÂ» function annihilated its carefree walled gardens of sanity.
! I've chose to retain the MeWe store button in the top bar, as I believe it's only fair to support a site one likes and to get extra emotes. I do however remove the emote ad in the emote picker.
! In light of MeWe thinking Web3 was a good idea (It wasn't), and me moving my last remaining DMs to Discord, this list is now deprecated.
