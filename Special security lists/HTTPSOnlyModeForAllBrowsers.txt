! Title: ðŸ”³ HTTPS-only Mode for All Browsers
! Version: 14June2024v1-Beta
! Expires: 30 days
! Description: I discovered in November 2023 that there was a non-zero market for this kind of list, so here it is.
! I still nevertheless recommend https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/smart-https/cmleijjdpceldbelpnpkddofmcmcaknm for most people, but I acknowledge that people would need to go the extra distance sometimes and need this list.
! I would NOT recommend this list for people who don't explicity need it, because online links where the site owners simply skipped the "https://" part entirely and started the link at "nrk.no/(â€¦)" or similar, will result in at the very least the page warning.
